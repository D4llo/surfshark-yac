# Surfshark-Yac

Surfshark Yet Another Client is a GUI client made on the package surfshark-client. Basically we convert the official deb package to the AUR format.

This repository was made with a lot of help from @jamiemagee. Thanks to him and his [template](https://github.com/JamieMagee/aur-packages-template).
